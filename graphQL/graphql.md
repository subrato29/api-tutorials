- graphQL is more flexible, more powerful, better performance that typical rest API.

- graphQL is an open source developed by facebook.

- The main advantage/difference between GraphQL and REST API is => using GraphQL the client can specify exactly the data it needs in a query.

- With REST, you have to make multiple requests to different endpoints to fetch the required data. ... In GraphQL on the other hand, you'd simply send a single query to the GraphQL server that includes the concrete data requirements

- In GraphQL, you will deal with 3 main concepts
	- query => by the queries, you are going to get the data from the server.(GET call)
	- mutation => Create, Update, Delete (Same like query, but it' a Write operation)
	- suscription => maintain real time connection with the server.
